Introduction
------------

This is a directory for [biospectrabysequencing](https://github.com/biospectrabysequencing) researchers to
start placing analysis scripts and documenting code snippets we already have within our institutions for potential 
use in the Quality control and sanity checking.

Generic code
------------
The goal is to create generic analysis scripts that are well documumented, and have a simple reproducible example
to run.
