## Summary of Best Practices

1. Write programs for people, not computers.
    + A program should not require its readers to hold more than a handful of facts in memory at once.
    + Make names consistent, distinctive, and meaningful.
    + Make code style and formatting consistent.
2. Let the computer do the work.
    + Make the computer repeat tasks.
    + Save recent commands in a file for re-use.
    + Use a build tool to automate workflows.
3. Make incremental changes.
    + Work in small steps with frequent feedback and course correction.
    + Use a version control system.
    + Put everything that has been created manually in version control.
4. Don't repeat yourself (or others).
    + Every piece of data must have a single authoritative representation in the system.
    + Modularize code rather than copying and pasting.
    + Re-use code instead of rewriting it.
5. Plan for mistakes.
    + Add assertions to programs to check their operation.
    + Use an off-the-shelf unit testing library.
    + Turn bugs into test cases.
    + Use a symbolic debugger.
6. Optimize software only after it works correctly.
    + Use a profiler to identify bottlenecks.
    + Write code in the highest-level language possible.
7. Document design and purpose, not mechanics.
    + Document interfaces and reasons, not implementations.
    + Refactor code in preference to explaining how it works.
    + Embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software.
8. Collaborate.
    + Use pre-merge code reviews.
    + Use pair programming when bringing someone new up to speed and when tackling particularly tricky problems.
    + Use an issue tracking tool.
