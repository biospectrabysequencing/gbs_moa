### Reproducible research in Biospectra by Sequencing (Roy Storey)

The BBS project is developing an analysis engine collaboratively on github using Moa for 
reproducibility and automation. Roy Storey will give an overview of our use of Moa and github.

### Random Tag Genotype by Sequencing (Marcus Davy)

Random Tag GBS is a protocol that has been developed in Plant and Food research as a potential 
alternative to the standard GBS protocol whcih offers considerable less size selection bias of Restriction site fragment sizes. This talk will discuss an experiment comparing rtGBS to stGBS in 96 samples from six kiwifruit genotypes
