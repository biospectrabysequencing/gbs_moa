### Reproducible research in Biospectra by Sequencing (Roy Storey)


Moa is a bioinformatics tool for Reproducible research. We are using Moa in conjunction with
github for collaboration and software deployment in the Biospectra By Sequencing collaboration.


### Random Tag Genotype by Sequencing (Marcus Davy)


Random Tag GBS is a protocol that has been developed in Plant and Food research as a potential 
alternative to the standard GBS protocol whcih offers considerable less size selection bias of Restriction site fragment sizes. This talk will discuss an experiment comparing rtGBS to stGBS in 96 samples from six kiwifruit genotypes
