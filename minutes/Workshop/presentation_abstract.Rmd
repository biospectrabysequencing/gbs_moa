### Reproducible research in Biospectra by Sequencing (Roy Storey)


Moa is a bioinformatics tool for Reproducible research. We are using Moa in conjunction with
github for collaboration and software deployment in the Biospectra By Sequencing collaboration.


### Random Tag Genotype by Sequencing (Marcus Davy)


Plant and Food research has developed Random Tag GBS (rtGBS) as an alternative protocol which offers considerably less restriction fragment size selection bias than the standard GBS protocol. Marcus Davy will talk about an experiment in kiwifruit designed to compare the two protocols
