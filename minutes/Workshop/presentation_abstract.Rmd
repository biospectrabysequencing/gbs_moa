### Reproducible research in Biospectra by Sequencing (Roy Storey)

The BBS project is developing an analysis engine collaboratively on github using Moa for 
reproducibility and automation. Roy Storey will give an overview of our use of Moa and github.

### Random Tag Genotype by Sequencing (Marcus Davy)

Plant and Food research has developed Random Tag GBS (rtGBS) as an alternative protocol which 
offers considerably less restriction fragment size selection bias than the standard GBS protocol. 
Marcus Davy will talk about an experiment in kiwifruit designed to compare the two protocols.
