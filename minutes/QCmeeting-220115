EResearch ( Queenstown 23-25 March )
Tony Lough has asked Rob to organise a workshop on BBS during the EResearch conference.
Rob has sent the abstract around so we can have a look and add things if we wish to.
NZGL would provide funding for 3 persons from the group to attend and present at this workshop and Rob (MBIE) would pay for 3 AgResearch persons. 
Mingshu is happy to be an author but not a presenter.
Patrick is going anyway, Charles or Marcus from plant and food could go. Roy or Marcus could go to talk about MOA.
Zane from Plant and food could also be invited and talk about the integration of Kea with the BBS pipeline. 
Rob is going to organise for 3 persons from AgResearch to go. 
Helge : what about the github training we talked about before ? and also github shiny ? 
Helge is to make a plan  …
QC 
Rob: Katie is happy and interested to help. She’ll join the group later on .
Ruy to get the final notes on the dataset they worked on with Rebecca .They had agreed on 3 different thresholds , QC checks before Tassel . Others things to look at are Kmers/sample , read number per sample, is blank blank ? 
Katie in Cromwell is looking for contamination – code not available for the moment.
Louis : There are a few reference database on the NZGL machine to use FastqScreen for a quick check . Louis will make the documentation available so everybody can use this if wanted. 
Alan : blast is slower but more comprehensive  (organelles, symbiots….) .
Ruy : what about positive control in each run ( something we know )
Marcus provided a link to github where QC discussion should be happening 
https://github.com/biospectrabysequencing/gbs_moa/issues/16
Rob  : QC should also happen after the pipeline, form the results .
Ruy and Charles : so what about the test datasets , we need a test suite , about maybe 6 different cases to test.
Rob : then the data confidentiality might be an issue if we want to share the testing dataset  
AP for Rob: data sharing issue.
the last option would be to dig into NCBI repositories but not preferred .
Rob : licencing : how to we make the code(s) available ? most likely GPL3 .  Is was discussed how to do it : have an agreement that when people contribute to the code, they agree that it will be then available under …. Licence . We don’t want to make the code freely available and then people would use it and sell a product ( Illumina and Geneious ? ) but we want as much people  as possible to use this code (put an author list file with the code files).
AgResearch  will manage this through the output release form. Helge will see how it works for plant and food, Shane for NZGL.
Patrick will liaise with Mingshu and Ruy about the QC and github seems to be the place to share info.
